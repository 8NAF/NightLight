You can support the app by translating the strings used in it. And thanks to all the people who have contributed in translating this project.

### How do I help translating this?
* [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/night-light).
* By forking this project, adding your translations and opening a pull request.
* If you are not familiar with the any of the above, you can simply download the string resource files ([this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corphish/NightLight/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corphish/NightLight/master/app/src/donate/res/values/strings.xml)), make your translations, and then mail me (at d97.avinaba@gmail.com) back the translated resource file. In the XML file, a string is represented as ```<string name="KEY_NOT_TO_BE_TRANSLATED">TEXT TO BE TRANSLATED</string>```. Simply translate the `TEXT TO BE TRANSLATED` portion. If there is an additional attribute ```translatable="false"```, then ignore that string.
